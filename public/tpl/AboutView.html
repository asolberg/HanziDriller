        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>This HanziDriller was inspired by the need for a simple yet efficient way of
        quickly drilling hundreds of Hanzi Characters and keeping track of those that 
        are the most difficult to memorize.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>Currently only one list is supported. You may study whatever section of the list
        you wish. It is recommended you also download and use an inscreen popup translator
        such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/perapera-kun-chinese-popup-tra/">this one.</a>
        </p>
        <p>When you don't know a character and need to look it up, click with the mouse to highlight it.
        At the end, you can click "next stage" to reduce the characters to ONLY those that
        you previously didn't know. You can continue reducing as long as you like until no more
        characters remain.</p>
        <p> Finally, click "I'm Done" and the system will record all the characters you had
        previously highlighted. In this way you can periodically check on your stats and 
        over time the characters that you most frequently have trouble with will emerge and
        you can focus more study time on them</p>

        <h4>Future Improvements</h4>
        <p>This is only a first version. In the future I would like to make more improvements 
        including multi-list support, multi-user support, an in-app translation pop-up, more stats,
        and more drilling options. Stay tuned.</p>
