About

This HanziDriller was inspired by the need for a simple yet efficient way of quickly drilling hundreds of Hanzi Characters and keeping track of those that are the most difficult to memorize.
Instructions

Currently only one list is supported. You may study whatever section of the list you wish. It is recommended you also download and use an inscreen popup translator such as this one.

When you don't know a character and need to look it up, click with the mouse to highlight it. At the end, you can click "next stage" to reduce the characters to ONLY those that you previously didn't know. You can continue reducing as long as you like until no more characters remain.

Finally, click "I'm Done" and the system will record all the characters you had previously highlighted. In this way you can periodically check on your stats and over time the characters that you most frequently have trouble with will emerge and you can focus more study time on them
Future Improvements

This is only a first version. In the future I would like to make more improvements including multi-list support, multi-user support, an in-app translation pop-up, more stats, and more drilling options. Stay tuned.
